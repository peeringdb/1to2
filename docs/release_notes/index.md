## Release 2.25.0

Release Date: 3 February, 2021

| **GitHub Issue** | **Summary** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| [#246 IXF should be IX-F ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/246) | This release introduces various spelling corrections. |
| [#828 IX-F importer: Handle ipv4/ipv6 on same vlan but separate connections ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/828) | This issue deals with how the IX-F importer handles information from the IX-F JSON import. PeeringDB handles both the IPv4 as well as the IPv6 address in the same object (`netixlan`). And from a peering partner pov this is ok as it doesn't matter whether these addresses are on the same interface or even same router. However, IX-F JSON differentiates. For the time being, the importer combines IPv4 and IPv6 if both are set to an operational status in the IX-F JSON. |
| [#846 IX-F importer: if ixf_ixp_member_list_url is null then ixf_ixp_import_enabled can't be true ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/846) | Apply logic to the meaning of `ixf_ixp_member_list_url`. i.e. only allow `ixf_ixp_import_enabled` to be set to `true` if a URL is specified. |
| [#875 "IXF-Importer: improved handling of how contacts are joined into direct conflict resolution deskpro tickets"](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/875) | Resolved an issue where responses to automatically generated Deskpro tickets were routed to the wrong ticket. |
| [#878 IXF-Importer: reorder of email content ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/878) | This is mainly an internal improvement. And fixes also not disclosing private IXP information to the public. |
| [#882 IXF-Importer: don't abort when there is nothing to import ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/882) | If there is nothing to import from an IX-F JSON don't abort with an error message. |
| [#893 IX-F Importer: history of changes per ixlan & netixlan ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/893) | Fixed bug related to the logging of importer changes. |
| [#896 IX-F Importer: Bogus output of "Preview" tool ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/896) | Fixed a bug in the preview tool, where `invalid member type ignored` messages weren't filtered for the network viewing the preview. |
| [#888 Type issue when overriding settings through environment variables for numeric types ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/888) | Fixed a bug and now ensure that overrides are coerced to the correct expected type. |
| [#872 Update dependencies ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/872) | Updated container to python 3.9 and addressed all dependencies.|
| [#694 add syntactic sugar for entering port speeds ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/694) | Simplifies the UI for editing port speeds to make it more human friendly. |
| [#717 Loading time issue /cp facility view ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/717) | Fixed slow load or timeouts for loading data for some facilities |
| [#837 Provide a friendlier explanation when entering / changing a phone number ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/837) | Provides a tooltip to help people enter E.164 formatted telephone numbers. |
| [#541 When looking at a network record, show last updated ix<->net or fac<->net date ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/541) | Improved information about when records were last updated. |

When re-sending an email add a note to the email stating "This email could not be delivered initially and may contain stale information". Add a field to the admin-com import emails table to show this note as well. Update sent if send is successful|
| [#832 - IX-F Importer: suggested update when it should be add + remove](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/832)| In some edge cases a deletion will end up as a requirement incorrectly to a legitimate new entry still. See #770 #816 |
| [#831 - [prod] IX-F importer: NameError: name 'EmailMultiAlternatives' is not defined ](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/831)| Fixes broken email function of `ix-f` importer |
| [#826 - Make technical poc mandatory when adding a netixlan](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/826)| Upon creating a netixlan object check that net has at least one (`Technical`, `NOC`, `Policy`) `poc` and that the `poc` has an e-mail address. If not ask them to create one first. Visibility of at least one (`Technical`, `NOC`, `Policy`) `poc` has to be "Users" resp. "Public" |
| [#825 - [beta] IX-F importer: Make Importer return non-zero when there is an error that Ops should see](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/825)| Improvements to `ix-f` importer that allow for easier notification and tracking of errors for the Ops team|

## Release 2.22.0
Beta Announcement Date: 15 July, 2020
Release Date: 26 August, 2020

| **GitHub Issue** | **Summary** |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| [#249 - Add the IX-F Member Export URL to the ixlan API endpoint](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/249) | There are two new fields in the ixlan section resp. the ixlan object, called ixf_ixp_member_list_url and ixf_ixp_member_list_url_visible. The first one contains the URL to the IX-F import file while the second governs the visibility of the URL. Values are the same as for the poc object, namely "Public", "Users" and "Private", defaulting to "Private" (i.e. or users who are members of the org). |
| [#268 - Database: unique constraints](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/268) | This issue fixes internal DB behaviour. |
| [#358 - Lock ASN once the record is created](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/358) | Once a network has been created, the field asn is made read-only. As the ASN is unique there is no reason to change it. Making the field read-only is to prevent unwanted side effects. |
| [#431 - Null 'rencode' from facility](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/431) | Null out all values for legacy unused rencode field, and make it read only to prepare for removal in PDB v3 [#625] (https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/625). |
| [#600 - Visibility for "Allow IXP update" switch](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/600) | A new field is added to the API net object, called allow_ixp_update. Furthermore, a line is added in global stats in the footer with a count (called "Automated Networks") of the networks which have "Allow IXP Update" enabled. |
| [#649 - Possible for 'ok' ixpfx to exist in 'pending' ixlan](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/649) | This issue fixes an internal bug. |
| [#683 - Add net_count_ixf field to ix object](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/683) | A field is added to the API object ix, called net_count_ixf, which indicates the number of net objects the exchange has in their IX-F JSON if they provide one. Otherwise, the value is null. |
| [#696 - Lock some objects from being deleted by the owner](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/696) | To protect operational data objects fac, ix, ixlan and org are prevented from being deleted as long as there are other objects related to it. First, these objects must be deleted before the object itself can be deleted. The attempt to delete such a protected object gives an error message and also opens a ticket with the PeeringDB support. |
| [#697 - Creating, changing, and deleting a netixlan object](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/697) | We completely re-implemented the way a connection to an exchange is handled. This new procedure allows both for a safe heads up a network can give to their peers as well as a safe way for exchanges to get rid of stale entries. Moreover, it allows networks to easily acknowledge new entries at exchanges which use the IX-F importer feature. See also the webinar for detailed information on this new procedure. |

In case the corresponding net object was deleted unintentionally the object is still kept in the DB. After 30 days it will be hard-deleted. |
| [#569 - Don't return any POC data with status=deleted](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/569) | POC objects do have a visibility scope. If a POC record is deleted it should not be able to retrieve it at all, even if visibility had been set to "public" before. The data will still be kept internally for 30 days for rollback if the deletion happened unintentionally. After 30 days the record will be hard-deleted.|
| [#580 - Add a clear error message, when user tries to re-add a previously deleted facility](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/580) | Bug fix for an unclear behaviour.
