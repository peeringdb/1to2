<p>Anna Claiborne</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I first used PeeringDB back in 2005 as a newcomer to the peering world to help establish and internally track peering relationships
for AS32787. PeeringDB was a critical resource in identifying possible peering relationships and connecting with the right people
within those networks.
</p>
<p>
I am currently SVP of Software Engineering for PacketFabric, a start-up in the networking and carrier space. As a software engineer
who has spent most of my career focused on network automation, I have a deep appreciation for community resources and open source
code.  Over my career I have contributed to several open source projects, served as the only neutral contributor and primary
technology support to the Global Peering Forum, Security Working Group Co-chair for ODCA, and worked as Board Liaison and Chair of
the Program Committee for Open-IX. From these experiences, as well as being early stage or late stage at a few start-ups (Prolexic,
Terremark, 6connect, PacketFabric), I have a deep understanding of how to drive progress with minimal resources and get people
involved in community groups and projects. I am also one of the few people who can write the code to make just about anything
happen! 
</p>
<p>
As a PeeringDB board member I will ensure organizational transparency, keep PeeringDB firmly in the hands of the community - free of
government oversight, focus on continual improvement of API functionality, and incorporate new features/community feedback to drive
PeeringDB functionality for the users.

<p>Denis Fondras</p>

<p>
I am a french freelancer and small network operator (AS60983). I have a 10-year
experience in networks and networked systems. In a previous job, I was in charge
of planning and establishing peering relationship.
</p>
<p>
Now I am the secretary of AuvernIX, a local IXP. As a really small non-profit
association, my role in AuvernIX is as much to write reports than to manage
contacts with other network operators and other IXP and do the plumbing. I am
also a part-time teacher at the local university (Université d'Auvergne) where I
teach Internet technologies.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB has always been an amazing tool to find informations about where to
peer with a network and it eases the work of small network owners a lot. As a
member I try to ensure the database is exhaustive and accurate. As a member of
the board, I am looking forward to help expand PeeringDB, get as many network,
facilities or IXP operators registered and active on PeeringDB as possible and
be the voice of smaller operators on the board.
</p>
<p>
I have never sat on board of an international organization and english is not my
native language but I know how an association works, how peering is important
for the Internet community and how it works, both technically and politically.

<a name="Gilmore" id="Gilmore"></a>
<p>Patrick W. Gilmore</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I have been involved in PeeringDB since its inception. My approach has 
been to keep the PeeringDB viciously agnostic, and guarantee each member
has absolute control over their own record. I honestly believe these
guiding principals are the reason so many people in so many places use and
trust the system. My primary goal in running for the board is to ensure
these principals continue to be followed as we transition from a few
volunteers helping when we can to a funded corporation.
</p>
<p>
Obviously the PeeringDB needs to be financially stable, highly secure, and 
stable for the long term. This is why we have a goal of becoming a
501(c)(6) non-profit corporation and are seeking funding. Adding features
such as anti-abuse and perhaps information sharing with other
organizations are worthy objectives to do or at least consider. But
everything should be done with the primary goals in mind - fairness and
member control.
</p>
<p>
If you feel the same, then I will be a strong advocate for your views.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I have been involved in multiple non-profit organizations, 
including transitioning NANOG from Merit to its own non-profit
corporation. I am confident I have experience which is useful to the
PeeringDB. Combined with my tenure at the PeeringDB, I believe this makes
me a good candidate for the Initial Board.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I would like to thank each of you for using the PeeringDB. 
The PeeringDB is only as useful as the members make it, and you have made
it the most important repository of peering information on the Internet.
It is truly humbling to have been involved in what I consider to be the
canonical example of a grass-roots community effort showing value and
bringing everyone together.

<p>
Hi - I'm Matt Griswold and I am currently Chairman and CTO for United
IX, an Internet exchange in Chicago. I have been coding and launching
technology companies since 1999. I am extremely passionate about
peering and Internet communities and have volunteered Euro-IX, NANOG,
Open-IX and PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
I started providing coding support and upgrades for PeeringDB in 2011.
Shortly after, I became an admin to assist in answering support
tickets, and gain a better understanding of user base and the
feature/improvement requests being made. After gaining a good insight
to the use cases, I began writing PeeringDB 2.0 to fulfill many of the
community requests for features and improvements. Getting PeeringDB 2.0
in beta has been a huge step forward, but there is still a substantial
amount of work to complete the vision for 2.0. Along with adding new
functionality and data objects, I want to ensure we maintain data
validity and interoperate with other community resources such as IXF
and ixp-memberlist schema to make PeeringDB a one stop canonical source
for any business needs.
</p>
<p>
This is an exciting time for everyone involved with PeeringDB. As a
member of the board, I will focus my efforts implementing even more
features from the long queue of requests and ideas and stay deeply
involved with the community. I sincerely hope to have the opportunity
to continue to contribute any way I can, and drive progress as
PeeringDB evolves. Let's revolutionize how interconnection databases
work and make the world a better place!

I'm a Senior Product Line Manager at Alcatel-Lucent, where I work with
service providers and Internet exchanges around the world to deliver
innovative internetworking solutions.  I've been an active member of the
network operator and peering community for nearly 20 years, and frequently
speak at network operator conferences on network technology and operational
topics.
</p>
<p>
Prior to joining Alcatel-Lucent, I held technical marketing and systems
engineering positions at Brocade Communications, Force10 Networks and
Riverstone Networks, and network engineering positions at MindSpring
Enterprises and Georgia Tech.
</p>
<p>
I am currently a member of the Open-IX IXP Standards Committee, Open-IX Board
member-elect, am ending a four year term on the NANOG Program Committee,
and am the chair of the Euro-IX Forum Programme Committee.
</p>
<p>
I would like to serve on the PeeringDB Board of Directors, to help
finally launch an independent organization that supports and grows this
indispensable peering resource for the community.  The first steps I would
help take after incorporation are to secure donations, to launch version
2.0, and to contract PeeringDB's maintenance and further development.
</p>
<p>
I have been volunteering as a PeeringDB admin for several months, so
I have a good working knowledge of all of the many pieces involved in
its daily operations.  My background and experience in the community,
combined with an unbiased perspective and a strong sense of commitment,
make me an excellent candidate for this position.

<p>
I’m a Senior Network Architect and interconnect strategist with the 
not-for-profit network NORDUnet (AS2603). Our main settlements is where
the winter is definitely always coming and we provide connectivity for
Research &amp; Education networks within the whole of Winterfe… Scandinavia.
With recent additions of the Baltics, Poland, Russia and Netherlands our
network is growing substantially.  What sets us apart from many others of
our friends in the R&amp;E World is that we are very keen on peering and have
always tried to keep up on what’s happening in the peering-world, both in
our own R&amp;E sector and in the commercial sector.
</p>
<p>
I'm a frequent visitor to any meetings, forums or *NOG’s that has any sort 
of peering or interconnect-track. We love peering and love to talk about
it, especially when it comes to automation we are quite far ahead and the
PeeringDB API is the success-factor behind our automatic
peering-functionalities.
</p>
<p>
I believe that PeeringDB is the best that has happened since sliced bread 
and one of the very key factors for its success is the ability for
PeeringDB to stay neutral and unbiased in all aspects. Being in the board
this would be my top-priority above all and with the fact that I represent
a organization that knows a thing or two about non-profit I think I can
provide a lot of valuable input on how organizations can be truly
transparent.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have 25 years in the business and I don’t have any RFCs to my 
name but I will always call a spade a spade even if it’s not the most
popular thing to say. I have no experience in being part of a
international board but what I do know is what the Peering-world needs,
and that is a free and unbiased PeeringDB.

<p>
I'm running for the PeeringDB Board to be an advocate for users of the
platform. The creation of this new Board allows us an opportunity to
make the platform more automated and user-friendly. Board members will
also help to ensure a smooth transition of PeeringDB to its new
governance framework in the coming months.
</p>
<p>
I've been a PeeringDB Admin for the past seven years. I've already
worked in the nooks and crannies of the platform, and know where we
can improve it. I've been very closely involved in the support
functions of PeeringDB, supporting queries for customer care. We need
a reliable and responsive support desk
</p>
<p>
We're in the process of transitioning to PeeringDB 2.0. As a member
of the Board, I'd focus on making 2.0 a stable platform, ensuring that
we have all the features and data that our users need to run their
daily business.
</p>
<p>
We also find ourselves in the midst of a very important transition to a
more automated platform. With the alliance to the new IX-F
organization, PeeringDB will be a primary source - globally - for
accurate, updated and standardized data about networks, IXPs, data
centers, colocation providers and more. I've been driving this process
forward with Euro-IX, and I'll work diligently to ensure all IXPs
globally develop their IXPA interface to make this a useful tool for
the worldwide community.
</p>
<p>
I bring more than 25 years of experience and expertise in the ISP and
IXP industry. I'm co-founder and current CTO/COO of DE-CIX. I have a
close eye on the global peering industry. I regularly attend NANOG,
DE-NOG, MENOG, APRICOT and other key global fora.
</p>
<p>
I love what I do, and I'd like to continue to serve this awesome
industry as a member of the PeeringDB Board of Directors.

<p>
PeeringDB is one of the most important online operator resources,
and as such I believe PeeringDB should remain an independent, free
of charge, neutral and foremost: a practical tool for everyday use.
</p>
<p>
I've built up useful experience leading long term community-driven
projects such as the NLNOG RING. Other volunteer experiences
include: NANOG (communications committee), NLNOG (chair), RIPE
(Database WG chair) and the IETF (contributor to international
standards). Full overview: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobsnijders
</p>
<p>
For the board to maintain a balanced view on things, multiple facets
of this industry should be represented: Content, IXP, Datacenter &amp;
IP backbone. As an architect for a global carrier I'll contribute my
perspective and help establish the interests of IP network operators
world-wide.
</p>
<p>
Together with a great team, I've helped run the operational side of
PeeringDB for the last several years, and hope to be given the trust
and opportunity to continue to guide PeeringDB forward.

<p>
I’d like to be considered for the board, and be a part of growing 
PeeringDB from a group of (awesome) super users and admins into an
independent organization befitting of such a useful tool.
</p>
<p>
I’ve only been in the internet industry since 2009. But I think I have a 
useful set of skills (some governance, product management, financial,
networking) that’d make me a good fit.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB is on a good path to be an efficient, consensus-driven, 
inclusive, and transparent non-profit. The community and the tool itself
deserve nothing less.
</p>
<p>
There’s quite a bit of excitement and maybe some apprehension about making 
sure PeeringDB starts in the right direction. I hope I’ll considered for
the Board and to make sure PeeringDB’s non-profit beginnings are as
sure-footed as possible.
