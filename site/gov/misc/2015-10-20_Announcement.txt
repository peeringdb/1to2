Subject: PeeringDB survey results and Board election plan

Results of the survey which ended August 15th, along with anonymous
comments are up at:

  https://www.caputo.com/pdb/20150800_PDB_Survey_results.pdf

91 responses, of which 89 voted for the main question:

 PeeringDB functions should be performed by:

 - 35 votes, 39.33%: "An independent 501(C)(6) (Not for profit) PeeringDB,
      with it's own elected board and members"

 - 14 votes, 15.73%: "The existing global standards body OpenIX 501(C)(6)
      (Not for profit)"

 - 10 votes, 11.24%: "The existing regional organization NANOG 501(C)(3)
      (Not for profit)"

 - 30 votes, 33.71%: "I don't care just as long as PeeringDB keeps
      working"

That looks like a clear vote for independence, given that the number for
independence is 45% more than the combined votes for OpenIX and NANOG.

Based on this, we are going to continue working toward becoming an 
independent non-profit corporation. In the interest of broad support, 
this is going to be done with transparency and inclusion using the pdb-gov 
mailing list. The plan:

 - If you want to participate in the process, please subscribe to the 
   pdb-gov "governance" mailing list with your PeeringDB account email.  

     http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov

 - Further emails will be sent to pdb-gov mailing list and posted to 
   http://gov.peeringdb.com/ as appropriate.

 - pdb-gov is where the draft organizational documents will be discussed
   and refined.  These draft documents are up at:

     https://www.caputo.com/pdb/

 - There will be elections for the initial Board of Directors. Candidacies 
   along with max 300 word statements should be submitted to 
   secretary@peeringdb.com prior to November 15th. Anyone can run for 
   election to the initial Board.

 - The interim Secretary (tentatively Chris Caputo) will send out ballots 
   to pdb-gov on November 15th, with voting to happen through November 
   30th.  The org docs currently proscribe [CORRECTION: prescribe] one ballot per member 
   organization.  The interim Secretary will break ties through public 
   random means.  The Secretary will not be eligible for election to the 
   initial Board.

 - The initial Board will decide on officers, per the tentative Bylaws.
   The draft documents will then be signed and filed.
